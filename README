# Advent of Code in Kotlin

Advent of Code â€“ an annual event in December since 2015. Every year since then, with the first day of December, a programming puzzles contest is published every day for twenty-five days. A set of Christmas-oriented challenges provides any input you have to use to answer using the language of your choice. In this repo we will be using Kotlin.

## Setup

fork it. maybe one day I'll have a Template but for now eh.

## Running

Everything start at Main.kt
at the root of the project use. it will use the gradle wrapper that's part of this project to run. so you should be able to use it on any IDE

`./gradlew run`

### Test

I like to use the example they provide to have a smaller and easier sample size to test the code against.
the command to use it is.

`./gradlew test`

#### JSYK

Kotlin compiler doesn't like you using their [keyword](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/keyword-reference.html) in package name so this package name is "aoc.\_in.kotlin".

I also took the Util from [advent-of-code-kotlin-template](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template/tree/main)
